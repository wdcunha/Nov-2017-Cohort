About to write to /home/wellington/CodeCore/fotorol/package.json:

{
  "name": "fotorol",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "An Exchange-a-gram clone written in Express",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Wellington Cunha",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this ok? (yes) // finish here
*** a file called package.json is created then, where is all informationa typed above



////  creates Express - JavaScript library (minimal and flexible Node.js web framework)
http://expressjs.com/
http://startupipsum.io/
>>> npm install express
it creates a folder named node_modules and inside of this, another one called express and if
all things are messed up, you can run 'npm install express' again

**** file package-lock.json  package lock


after that, it is needed to commit
*** git add.
*** git commit -m 'Install express'

curl https://www.gitignore.io/api/node,macos > .gitignore

>> Install Nodemon
npm install --save-dev nodemon

*** inside package.json it's necessary to insert the follow line:
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "start": "nodemon index.js"
},
>>>  after to save the file above, it needs to run the command line below to produce the effects expected
and finally we can run nodemon:
npm run start  *** will need to run this all the time we want to run the server instead of nodemon index.js
                   because it was installed locally, not globally


>>> Morgan - is a library of middleware to show servers log information from Express
npm install morgan (not using node as in the material)


>>>   EJS ---> templates provide simple sintax to generate text with a programming language, in this case,
>>> JavaScript
http://ejs.co/
npm install ejs  ----> It's easy to install EJS with NPM
apm install language  ----> this is a package for Atom see ejs action

after those above, creates a file home.ejs


>>> body-parser ----> allow middleware to process form data
https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser
npm install body-parser
