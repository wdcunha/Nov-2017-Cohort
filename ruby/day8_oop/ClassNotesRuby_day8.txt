***Class and objects
Object Oriented Program  --->

# When using Pry you can load a file by doing:
# `load './cookie.rb'` or `require './cookie.rb'`
# require will not load the file if it has been `required` or loaded already.
# this is useful when you have a big project so if the file is loaded once no
# need to reload it again.
# `load` is useful when you developing and making lots of changes to the file
# then it will force loading the file even if it's been previously loaded.

***when you define arguments in the constructor:
def initialize(sugar, flour)

you need to pass those ones when call the class or it'll give errror:
c = Cookie.new(10,15)

$ before the variable name become it global, what is a problem and won't be used because of it

***attr_accessor :flour
  # is equivalent to:
  # attr_reader :flour
  # attr_writer :flour
To call it: just call flour

# def sugar=(new_amount)
  #   @sugar = new_amount
  # end

**
when a class inherits another, you need to pass all arguments present in the initialize methods


**
cookie_bag
