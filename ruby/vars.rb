# Variables in Ruby fllow the snake case convention, for instance
first_name = 'Well'

# remember that Variables names can contain naumbers but naumbers can be the first
# character in the Variables

a1 = 'John' # this is good
1a = 'John' # # this will throw an error

# this is called `screaming case` and it's used to define constants in your
# application where you don't expect the value to change
MAX_NUMBER = 10
